Below is the process followed while working on the problem of Fitness Watch Data Analysis:

Collect data from fitness watches, ensuring it’s accurate and reliable.
Perform EDA to gain initial insights into the data.
Create new features from the raw data that might provide more meaningful insights.
Create visual representations of the data to communicate insights effectively.
Segment user’s activity based on time intervals or the level of fitness metrics and analyze their performance.

So, the process starts with collecting data from a fitness watch. Every fitness watch works with an app on your smartphone. You can collect data from that app on your smartphone. For example, in my case, I collected my fitness watch’s data from Apple’s Health app. If you will also collect fitness data from any app, it will not be in a format to be used for analysis. So, I have already made a clean version of the data available online.

#--insights gained--#

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the distribution, trends, and patterns of each fitness metric.
Created visualizations to depict how different metrics vary over time, across different time intervals, or in relation to one another.
Analyzed how step count, distance, energy burned, and other metrics correlate with each other.
Identifed potential patterns in walking efficiency, energy expenditure, and the relationship between step count and walking speed.
